Project Brief: Custom DNS-Based User Management System with Gamification
Objective

To develop a custom DNS-based system that helps users manage their internet usage by blocking or allowing specific sites based on user-defined rules, integrating a gamification system to encourage healthier online habits.
Key Features

    Custom DNS Server Infrastructure:
        Develop a custom DNS server that handles DNS queries dynamically based on individual user settings.
        Support DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH) and DNS-over-TLS (DoT) for secure DNS query transmission.

    User Management and Profiles:
        Create a backend system to manage user accounts, unique identifiers, and personalized DNS rules.
        Store user-specific configurations, such as which domains to block or allow, in a database.

    Dynamic DNS Configuration:
        Implement a dynamic DNS configuration generator that updates DNS rules in real time based on user actions.
        Utilize DNS software such as PowerDNS or CoreDNS to handle DNS queries using an HTTP API or database backend.

    Gamification Integration:
        Develop a system where users earn or spend points/tokens to control their internet access.
        Implement a user dashboard where users can view usage statistics, manage rules, and engage in gamified activities.

    Real-Time Rule Updates:
        Enable instant updates to DNS configurations when users modify their settings, ensuring immediate effect without waiting for DNS caches to clear.
        Use short TTLs and cache invalidation techniques to reflect changes quickly.

    User Dashboard and Interface:
        Design a user-friendly web or mobile application where users can:
            Set and modify DNS rules.
            Track internet usage and receive feedback.
            Participate in challenges and earn rewards through gamification.

    Data Security and Privacy:
        Ensure all user data and DNS queries are securely stored and transmitted.
        Use encryption (TLS/HTTPS) and adhere to privacy standards.

Technical Implementation Steps

    Set Up DNS Server:
        Choose DNS software (PowerDNS or CoreDNS) with support for dynamic configuration.
        Configure the server to use a custom backend (database or HTTP API) for user-specific rules.

    Develop Backend System:
        Build an API server to manage user profiles, rules, and gamification elements.
        Store user data and DNS configurations in a secure database.

    Create Dynamic Rule Update Mechanism:
        Implement real-time update capabilities using WebSockets, SSE, or REST API calls.
        Utilize caching strategies (in-memory caches, short TTLs) for fast DNS response and rule propagation.

    Build User Dashboard:
        Develop a responsive web or mobile app for user interaction.
        Include features for rule management, usage statistics, and gamification activities.

    Security and Compliance:
        Implement encryption for DNS queries (DoH/DoT).
        Ensure compliance with data privacy regulations and best practices.

Expected Challenges

    Scalability: Ensuring the DNS server can handle a large number of dynamic requests with minimal latency.
    Security: Protecting against DNS-based attacks (e.g., DDoS, cache poisoning) and safeguarding user data.
    User Adoption: Designing a user experience that is intuitive and effectively encourages healthier internet use through gamification.


Conclusion

This project aims to create a robust, user-focused DNS management tool that leverages gamification to promote healthier online behaviors. By combining technical expertise with innovative design, the system will offer a unique solution for users seeking greater control over their internet usage.
